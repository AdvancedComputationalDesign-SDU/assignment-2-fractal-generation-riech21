## Pseudo-Code

*(Provide detailed pseudo-code explaining the logic of your program. This should clearly outline your recursive functions, parameter definitions, and how they contribute to the final fractal pattern.)*

Example:

1. **Define Main Function `generate_fractal(start_point, angle, length, depth)`**
   - **Inputs**:
     - `start_point`: Tuple of coordinates (x, y).
     - `angle`: Current angle in degrees.
     - `length`: Length of the current line segment.
     - `depth`: Current recursion depth.
   - **Process**:
     - **If** `depth` is 0:
       - **Return** (End recursion).
     - **Else**:
       - Calculate `end_point` using trigonometry:
         - `end_x = start_x + length * cos(radians(angle))`
         - `end_y = start_y + length * sin(radians(angle))`
       - Create a line from `start_point` to `end_point` using Shapely.
       - **For** each branch (e.g., left and right):
         - **Calculate** new angle:
           - Left branch: `new_angle = angle + angle_change`
           - Right branch: `new_angle = angle - angle_change`
         - **Calculate** new length:
           - `new_length = length * length_scaling_factor`
         - **Recursive Call**:
           - `generate_fractal(end_point, new_angle, new_length, depth - 1)`
     - **Return** (After recursive calls).

2. **Initialize Parameters**
   - Set `start_point`, `initial_angle`, `initial_length`, `recursion_depth`, `angle_change`, `length_scaling_factor`.

3. **Call `generate_fractal` Function**
   - Begin the fractal generation by calling `generate_fractal(start_point, initial_angle, initial_length, recursion_depth)`.

4. **Visualization**
   - Collect all the lines generated.
   - Use Matplotlib to plot the lines.
   - Apply any visualization enhancements (colors, line widths).

## Technical Explanation

*(Provide a concise explanation of your code, focusing on recursion and geometric manipulations. Discuss how your approach generates the final fractal pattern and the mathematical principles involved.)*

Example:

In my implementation, the `generate_fractal` function recursively draws line segments representing branches of a fractal tree. The function calculates the end point of each line using trigonometric functions based on the current angle and length.

At each recursion step, the function:

- Decreases the `length` by multiplying it with `length_scaling_factor`.
- Adjusts the `angle` by adding or subtracting `angle_change` to create branching.
- Calls itself recursively for each branch until the `recursion_depth` reaches zero.

This approach creates a self-similar pattern characteristic of fractals, where each branch splits into smaller branches in a consistent manner.

## Results

*(Include images of your generated fractal patterns, and discuss any observations or interesting findings.)*

Example:

### Fractal Pattern 1: Basic Fractal Tree

![Fractal Tree](images/example.png)

- **Parameters**:
  - `angle_change`: 30°
  - `length_scaling_factor`: 0.7
  - `recursion_depth`: 5
- **Observations**:
  - The fractal tree exhibits symmetry and balance.
  - As the recursion depth increases, the level of detail in the branches increases.

*(Repeat for other fractal patterns.)*

## Challenges and Solutions

*(Discuss any challenges you faced during the assignment and how you overcame them.)*

Example:

- **Challenge**: Managing the growing number of line segments and ensuring they are correctly plotted.
  - **Solution**: Stored all line segments in a list and plotted them after the recursion completed.

- **Challenge**: Implementing randomness without losing the overall structure.
  - **Solution**: Introduced randomness within controlled bounds for angles and lengths.
