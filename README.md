# Assignment 2: Exploring Fractals through Recursive Geometric Patterns

![Example Fractal](images/example.png)

## Objective

In this assignment, you will explore the fascinating world of fractals using concepts of recursion and functional programming, building upon your knowledge of conditionals, iterations, and N-dimensional arrays. Your task is to create a Python script that generates complex fractal visualizations based on a custom L-system or Lindenmayer system in 2D, commonly used in game development and computer graphics for modeling natural phenomena like tree-like structures.

Your script should:

- Implement recursive functions that follow a set of geometric manipulation rules to generate fractal patterns using geometric objects (lines, polylines) with **Shapely**.
- Allow customization of basic parameters, such as angles, length scaling factors, and recursion depth.
- Present additional custom parameters or control logic
- Produce at least **five distinctly different outputs** by varying these parameters or the rules themselves.
- **Optional (for extra points):**
  - Use random module controlably to achieve greater visual complexity.
  - Explore beyond 2D by extending your implementation to **3D space**.
  - Utilize custom color schemes in your visualizations.
  - Modify the geometric rules to create more complex or uniquely stylized patterns.

## Tasks

1. **Implement Recursive Geometric Script**

   - Create a Python script (`fractal_generator.py`) that uses recursive functions to generate fractal patterns based on geometric transformations.
   - Use the **Shapely** library to create and manipulate geometric objects, specifically for drawing lines and polylines.
   - Define the parameters of your fractal explicitly in your script:
     - **Starting Point**: The initial coordinate from which the pattern generation starts.
     - **Initial Angle**: The starting orientation of the pattern.
     - **Angle Change**: The angle by which the direction changes at each recursive step.
     - **Length**: The initial length of the lines drawn.
     - **Length Scaling Factor**: How the length of lines changes with each recursion.
     - **Recursion Depth**: The number of times the recursive function calls itself.
   - Allow customization of these parameters to enable exploration of different fractal patterns.
   - **Optional:** Incorporate random module to achieve greater visual complexity.


2. **Generate Distinct Outputs**

   - Use your script to produce at least **five distinctly different fractal patterns** by varying the parameters or the geometric rules.
   - Save each output as an image in the `images/` folder with descriptive filenames.

   - Use appropriate visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib) to plot your fractal patterns.
   - Utilize Shapely's integration with Matplotlib for plotting geometric objects.
   - **Optional:** Enhance your visualizations with custom color schemes.
   - Consider line thickness, color gradients, or other visual effects to improve the aesthetic appeal.

4. **Explore Advanced Concepts**

   - **Extend to 3D Space**:
     - Modify your script to generate fractals in 3D using libraries such as `matplotlib` with `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` or `plotly`.
     - Handle 3D coordinates manually or use appropriate interactive 3D visualization libraries.
   - **Modify Geometric Rules**:
     - Experiment with different geometric transformations beyond simple branching.
     - Incorporate randomness or use different geometric shapes.

5. **Documentation**

   - Write detailed pseudo-code explaining your recursive functions in `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
   - Provide technical explanations of your algorithms.
   - Include a short report (max 300 words) discussing the process and the mathematical principles behind the fractals you created.
   - Insert images of your generated fractals into the documentation.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**

   - Ensure all dependencies are installed.
   - Familiarize yourself with the repository structure.

3. **Implement the Geometric Recursive Script with Shapely**

   - Open `fractal_generator.py`.
   - **Define the Parameters** explicitly in your script:
     - **Starting Point** (`tuple`): The initial coordinate (e.g., `(0, 0)`).
     - **Initial Angle** (`float`): The starting orientation in degrees (e.g., `90` for upwards).

     - **Length** (`float`): The initial length of the lines drawn.

     - Write a function that:
       - Draws a line segment from the current point in the current direction.
       - Updates the current position based on the length and angle.
       - Recursively calls itself to create branches.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional for Extra Points)

### Extending to 3D Space

- **Implement 3D Fractals**:
  - Introduce a Z-axis and modify your recursive function to handle 3D coordinates.
  - Adjust your geometric transformations to include rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes.
  - Handle position and orientation in 3D space.

- **Visualizing in 3D**:
  - Use `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` in Matplotlib:

    ```python
    from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    ax.plot(xs, ys, zs)
    plt.show()
    ```

  - Or use `plotly` for interactive 3D plots:

    ```python
    import plotly.graph_objects as go

    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter3d(x=xs, y=ys, z=zs, mode='lines')])
    fig.show()
    ```

### Custom Color Schemes

- **Color Based on Depth**:

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def get_color(depth, max_depth):
      return plt.cm.viridis(depth / max_depth)

  # Plot using the color
  color = get_color(current_depth, max_depth)
  ```

- **Color Gradients**:
  - Use color maps to apply gradients along the lines.
  - Consider using libraries like `matplotlib.colors` for advanced color manipulations.

### Modify Geometric Rules

- **Incorporate Randomness**:
  - Introduce randomness in angles or lengths to create more natural-looking patterns.
  - Example:

    ```python
    import random

    angle_change = random.uniform(20, 40)
    length_scaling = random.uniform(0.6, 0.8)
    ```

- **Use Different Shapes**:
  - Instead of lines, use circles, ellipses, or polygons at recursion steps.
  - Use Shapely's geometric objects to create complex patterns.
